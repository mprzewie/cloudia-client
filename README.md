# cloudia-client #

A webapplication written with [Scalatra framework](http://scalatra.org/) which can be used to manage [cloudia-servers](https://github.com/mprzewie/cloudia-server) connected to it. Just like in case of servers, it uses [Cloudia nodes](https://github.com/mprzewie/cloudia-utils).

## Build & Run ##
In cloudia-client directory:
```sh
$ sbt
> jetty:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/node/](http://localhost:8080/node/) in your browser.

## documentation
Coming soon.


This is a part of a project for Scala Programming class by mgr. Łukasz Faber and dr. Roman Dębski at AGH UST.
